# Rick and Morty App Project

Welcome to the repository of the Rick and Morty App project. This project has been developed using SwiftUI with an MVVM architecture following a CLEAN methodology.

## Content

The application contains three main views:

1. **Characters**: Where you can see all the characters from the Rick and Morty series.
2. **Locations**: You can explore the different locations of the Rick and Morty multiverse.
3. **Favorites**: Here you can see all your favorite characters that you have marked in the character view.

## Functionality

- **Search Characters**: In the character view, you can search for your favorite character by name.
- **Mark as Favorite**: You can mark any character as your favorite by simply clicking on the favorite icon on each character card.
- **Remove from Favorites**: If you no longer want a character to show in your favorites, you have two ways to remove it:
    1. Simply deselect the favorite icon on the character card.
    2. Press and hold on the character and select 'Delete' from the context menu that appears.

## Implementation

The project follows an MVVM architecture and is implemented using SwiftUI. Following the principles of the CLEAN methodology, the code is structured into separate layers, allowing easier and cleaner development and maintenance.
